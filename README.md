# Example Export FoxPro Format File Into Database With Codeigniter 4

This project aims to develop a web application using the CodeIgniter 4 (CI4) framework that enables exporting data from FoxPro (.dbf) files to a relational database such as MySQL. Key features include user authentication, file upload, data extraction, data import, and a dashboard interface to monitor import status. With this application, the process of migrating data from .dbf files to modern databases will become easier and more efficient.
